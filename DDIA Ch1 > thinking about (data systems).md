- components (DB, queue, caches)
   - distinct access patterns, performance, implementations
---
- why do we need a cohesive concept (data system)
   - new tools emerged (doesn't fit into trad categories)
      - **Redis (DB * queue)**
      - **Kafka (queue * DB-like duribility)**
   - reqs are now wide-ranging
      - no tool that fits all
      - had to break down work (implementations)
      - **tools are now "stitched" to form an application**
   - example
      - BE managed caching layer (Memcached, cache-aside)
      - full-text search server (Elasticsearch/Solr)
      - BE is responsible of keeping state in sync
      - exposed API to client
         - you now have a special-purpose data system

- factors that influences system design
   - team member
   - legacy, dependencies
   - risk, compliance

- major concerns of the book
   - **reliability**
      - should continue to function, even face faults
   - **scalability**
      - system would eventually grow
      - reasonable ways to deal with growth
   - **maintainability**
      - humans are the major contributor to system
      - how can team work productively
