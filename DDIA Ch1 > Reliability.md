- intuition
   - should perform user-expected action
   - should tolerate user's mistakes/misuse
   - good enough performance
   - prevent unauth access/abuse
---
- in technical terms
   - **continue to work (correctly), even when things go wrong**
   - called: fault-tolerant/resilient systems
   - what could go wrong
      - **faults**
         - not all faults should be considered
            - blackhole example
         - not the same as "failure"
            - **failure -> system stopped working completely (crashed)**
         - **fault is any deviation from the specification**
         - impossible to eliminate
         - solution
            - (major) prevent fault from causing failures (tolerate faults)
            - (minor) prevent faults
               - security fault cannot be undone
         - test regularly (Netflix example)

- (fault types) hardware faults
   - intuition
      - disk crash
         - hard disk "mean time to failure" -> 10 ~ 50 years
         - 10k disks, average 1 dies per day
      - RAM faulty
      - **power grid blackout**
      - **in datacenter, happen all the time**
   - solution
      - redundancy
         - disk -> RAID setup
         - power -> dual supply, backup power
         - hot-swap CPUs
         - already thoroughly studied
      - **(hardware) component redundancy**
         - was sufficient back then
         - restorations are acceptable
      - **machine/system redundancy**
         - as data volumes increase, req min downtime
         - hardware faults are more (in number), as system grow complex
         - **now we have to even tolerate (handle) entire system/machine loss**
         - advantage
            - partial patch, migrations, reboot
---
- (fault types) software errors
   - hardware errors are random/independent
   - software faults
      - **usually systematic**
         - causing more (cascade) system failures
         - Linux kernel bug example
         - process used up hardware cap (RAM, disk, network cap)
         - service slow down, corrupted responses
      - **hard to immediately identify, solutions**
         - carefully planning
         - tests
         - monitoring
         - analyze outcome
---
- (fault types) human errors
   - (should relate to maintainability?)
   - humans are an unreliable source
      - **config error -> leading cause of failure**
   - solutions
      - DX/UX
         - minimizes opportunities of error 
      - decouple/protect error-prone parts
         - having sandbox, readonly prod access
      - thorough tests (unit, integration, manual)
      - **quick & easy recovery (from human errors)**
         - faster/templated roll back
         - gradual deployment
      - monitoring
         - performance metrics
         - error rates
---
- importance
   - revenue, reputation
   - conscious of cutting corners
